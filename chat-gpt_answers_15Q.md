### 1. What is a random walk in the context of a network?

A random walk on a network is a stochastic process in which an agent moves from node to node by following edges, selecting the next node according to a transition probability defined by the network’s topology (e.g., uniformly among neighbors).

---

### 2. What is meant by a multiplex (multi-layer) network?

A multiplex network consists of the same set of nodes connected by multiple distinct layers, where each layer represents a different type of interaction or relationship, and nodes can have inter-layer connections to their counterparts.

---

### 3. What does the term stationary probability distribution refer to?

It is the limiting probability distribution over nodes reached by a random walk after a long time, where the probability of finding the walker at each node no longer changes with time.

---

### 4. What are scalar perturbations in cosmology?

Scalar perturbations are density and pressure fluctuations that affect the curvature of spacetime but have no directional preference; they are responsible for the formation of large-scale structure in the universe.

---

### 5. What physical system do the airline transportation networks represent in the corpus?

They represent real-world transportation systems where nodes correspond to airports and edges correspond to flight connections, often modeled as multiplex networks with layers representing different airlines.

---

### 6. How does a biased random walk differ from an unbiased random walk?

In a biased random walk, transition probabilities depend on node or edge attributes (e.g., degree, weight, centrality), whereas in an unbiased walk transitions depend only on network connectivity, typically chosen uniformly.

---

### 7. What is the role of entropy rate in characterizing a random walk?

The entropy rate quantifies the randomness and unpredictability of the walk’s trajectory; higher entropy rates correspond to more exploratory and less predictable dynamics.

---

### 8. Why are multi-layer networks considered more realistic than single-layer networks?

Because real systems typically involve multiple types of interactions simultaneously, and multiplex networks preserve interaction-specific structure that is lost when all connections are aggregated into a single layer.

---

### 9. What does gauge invariance ensure in cosmological perturbation theory?

Gauge invariance ensures that physical predictions are independent of the choice of coordinate system, meaning observable perturbations are not artifacts of coordinate transformations.

---

### 10. How does edge overlap affect diffusion on multiplex networks?

High edge overlap between layers reduces the effective diversity of pathways, often slowing diffusion by making layers redundant rather than complementary.

---

### 11. How are extensive and intensive bias functions defined, and why do they differ in parameter scaling?

Extensive bias functions scale with system size or node degree, amplifying effects in larger networks, while intensive bias functions remain normalized and size-independent, leading to different parameter scaling behaviors.

---

### 12. In what way does the overlapping adjacency matrix differ from a simple aggregated network representation?

The overlapping adjacency matrix explicitly counts shared edges across layers, whereas simple aggregation collapses layers without preserving information about inter-layer overlap.

---

### 13. How does inter-layer degree correlation influence the dispersiveness of biased random walks?

Positive inter-layer degree correlation concentrates walkers on hubs across layers, reducing dispersiveness, while negative correlation promotes exploration by distributing walkers more evenly.

---

### 14. Why does the extended electromagnetic vector field introduce additional scalar modes in cosmology?

Because relaxing the standard electromagnetic gauge constraint allows longitudinal components of the vector field to propagate, introducing extra scalar degrees of freedom.

---

### 15. How do real-world multiplex airline networks demonstrate a trade-off between diffusion efficiency and robustness?

Dense interconnections improve diffusion efficiency but increase vulnerability to targeted disruptions, while reduced overlap and modularity enhance robustness at the cost of slower diffusion.
